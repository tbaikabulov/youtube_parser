Learn all the basics you need to get started with this deep learning framework!\n\nPart 08: Classify Star Wars Lego Figures | Full Project Walkthrough\n\nIn this part we use a real image dataset from Kaggle with Lego Star Wars Minifigures and do a full project walkthrough. I show you how to load the data using a tensorflow ImagaDataGenerator and implement a convolutional neural net to do image classification. I also introduce some new concepts like image augmentation and keras callbacks.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GREAT PLUGINS FOR YOUR CODE EDITOR ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\ud83e\ude81 Code faster with Kite: https://www.kite.com/get-kite/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=pythonengineer&utm_content=description-only *\n\u2705 Write cleaner code with Sourcery: https://sourcery.ai/?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=pythonengineer *\n\nGet my Free NumPy Handbook:\nhttps://www.python-engineer.com/numpybook\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 SUPPORT ME ON PATREON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nhttps://www.patreon.com/patrickloeber\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to the channel!\n\nCourse material is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/python-engineer/tensorflow-course\n\nDownload the dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ihelon/lego-minifigures-classification\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/\n\nYou can find me here:\nWebsite: https://www.python-engineer.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/python_engineer\nGitHub: https://github.com/python-engineer\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com/\n\n#Python\n\nCourse Parts:\n01 TensorFlow Installation\n02 TensorFlow Tensor Basics\n03 TensorFlow Neural Net\n04 TensorFlow Linear Regression\n05 TensorFlow CNN (Convolutional Neural Nets)\n06 TensorFlow Save & Load Models\n07 TensorFlow Functional API\n08 TensorFlow Multi-output Project\n09 TensorFlow Transfer Learning\n10 TensorFlow RNN / LSTM / GRU\n11 TensorFlow NLP\n\nTensorFlow 2, Keras, Deep Learning, TensorFlow Course, TensorFlow Beginner Course, TensorFlow Tutorial\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* This is a sponsored link.

We will then see how a PyTorch model is implemented and used for the forward pass.\n\n- Training Pipeline in PyTorch\n- Model Design\n- Loss and Optimizer\n- Automatic Training steps with forward pass, backward pass, and weight updates\n\nPart 06: Training Pipeline: Model, Loss, and Optimizer\n\n\ud83d\udcda Get my FREE NumPy Handbook:\nhttps://www.python-engineer.com/numpybook\n\n\ud83d\udcd3 Notebooks available on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/patrickloeber\n\n\u2b50  Join Our Discord : https://discord.gg/FHMg9tKFSN\nIf you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to the channel!\n\nOfficial website:\nhttps://pytorch.org/\n\nPart 01:\nhttps://youtu.be/EMXfZB8FVUA\n\nLinear Regression from scratch:\nhttps://youtu.be/4swNt7PiamQ\n\nCode for this tutorial series:\nhttps://github.com/python-engineer/pytorchTutorial\n\nYou can find me here:\nWebsite: https://www.python-engineer.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/python_engineer\nGitHub: https://github.com/python-engineer\n\n#Python #DeepLearning #Pytorch\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* This is a sponsored link.
